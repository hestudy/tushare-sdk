# Specification Quality Checklist: SDK文档站

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

所有检查项均已通过。规格说明已准备就绪,可以进入下一阶段。

### Key Decisions Made

1. **多版本支持**: 初期单版本,架构预留扩展性
2. **文档来源**: 混合方式 - 结构化信息自动生成,描述性内容手动编写

## Notes

规格说明已完成并通过质量验证,可以执行 `/speckit.plan` 进入实现规划阶段。
